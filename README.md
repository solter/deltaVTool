# deltaVTool
Python tool to calculate delta V for various destinations in solar system

This tool was created based on the third [RSS-∆v-Maps](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/wiki/RSS-%E2%88%86v-Maps) ([original full-size image](https://i.redd.it/9l22vgf5v9p41.png)). The data on the map was input into a tree data structure, and the tool then does a tree search to find the route from the inital point to the final point and adds together all the ∆v values between them.
